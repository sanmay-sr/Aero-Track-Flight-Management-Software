The air management mini project aims to develop a flight management system using the C programming language. This system facilitates the management of airports, flights, and bookings. Users can perform various tasks such as adding airports, adding flights between airports, booking flights, cancelling bookings, and displaying flight information.
The system provides an interactive command-line interface through which users can input commands to interact with the system. Administrators have privileges to add airports and flights, while users can book and cancel bookings for flights.
Key features of the system include the ability to display available flights, both direct and indirect, between airports. The system also allows users to book flights, considering both direct and indirect routes if available, and maintains records of booked flights.
The project demonstrates the implementation of data structures and algorithms for managing airport and flight information efficiently. It also showcases concepts such as file handling for data persistence, user authentication, and input validation for ensuring system security and reliability.
Overall, the air management mini project serves as an illustrative example of using C programming for developing a practical and functional flight management system, offering insights into software development methodologies and techniques in the context of air travel management.
